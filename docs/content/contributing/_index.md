## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable lint issues
npm run lint:fix
```

**Key principles:**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test guidelines:**
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for new features
- Browser compatibility tests for UI changes
- Performance tests for optimization changes

### Documentation Standards

When adding features:
- Update relevant documentation files
- Add JSDoc comments to public methods
- Include usage examples
- Update the changelog

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```

[optional footer]
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add support for timed quizzes
fix(i18n): correct German translation for submit button

```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
